# DOM*j*nate

DOMjnate is a Java library that allows you to manipulate HTML DOM JavaScript APIs entirely from Java. The name comes from the DOM of HTML's Document Object Model, a J for Java, and the word "dominate" to represent the goal of using HTML5 for all Java user interface code.

It is mainly intended as an alternative to [Elemental 2](https://github.com/google/elemental2).
